# Prework-Study-Guide Webpage

## Digital study guide created by a boot camp student to help themselves along with others with notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript


## Description

- The key motivator for creating this website was to have access to a digital form of notes which was easily accessible to me, and any student or beginner looking to view some basic information

- This project was built to complement the use of the web while learning or developing code, and to reduce the amount of paper used while engaging in note taking

- My Prework-Study-Guide fixes the inevitable need to take notes while furthering your knowledge without using pen and paper while also enabling others who may be learning alongside you to duplicate your responses to add to their notes

- Developing this application allowed me to experience hands-on coding while simultaneously noting the computer language I was currently using such as HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript
